# Solidity API

## ERC1363

_Implementation of the ERC-1363 interface.

Extension of ERC-20 tokens that supports executing code on a recipient contract after `transfer` or `transferFrom`,
or code on a spender contract after `approve`, in a single transaction._

### supportsInterface

```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view virtual returns (bool)
```

_Returns true if this contract implements the interface defined by
`interfaceId`. See the corresponding
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165#how-interfaces-are-identified[EIP section]
to learn more about how these ids are created.

This function call must use less than 30 000 gas._
