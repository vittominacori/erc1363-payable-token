ERC-1363 allows to implement an ERC-20 smart token. 

It means that we can add a callback to be executed after transferring or approving tokens.

This is an implementation of the [EIP-1363](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1363) that defines an interface for ERC-20 tokens that supports executing code on a recipient contract after `transfer` or `transferFrom`, or code on a spender contract after `approve`, in a single transaction.

## Abstract
There is no way to execute any code on a receiver or spender contract after an ERC-20 `transfer`, `transferFrom` or `approve` so, to make an action, it is required to send another transaction.

This introduces complexity on UI development and friction on adoption because users must wait for the first transaction to be executed, and then send the second one. They must also pay GAS twice.

This proposal aims to make tokens capable of performing actions more easily and working with contracts without the use of any other external listener.
It allows to make a callback on a receiver or spender contract, after a transfer or an approval, in a single transaction.

There are many proposed uses of Ethereum smart contracts that can accept EIP-20 callbacks.

Examples could be

* to create a token payable crowdsale
* selling services for tokens
* paying invoices
* making subscriptions

For these reasons it was originally named **"Payable Token"**.

Anyway you can use it for specific utilities or for any other purposes who require the execution of a callback after a transfer or approval received.

## Install

```bash
npm install erc-payable-token
```

## Usage

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import {ERC1363} from "erc-payable-token/contracts/token/ERC1363/ERC1363.sol";

contract MyToken is ERC1363 {

    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol) ERC20(name, symbol) {
        // your stuff
    }

  // your stuff
}
```

### IERC1363

[IERC1363.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1363/IERC1363.sol)

Interface of the ERC1363 standard as defined in the [EIP-1363](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1363).

```solidity
interface IERC1363 is IERC20, IERC165 {
    function transferAndCall(address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
    function transferAndCall(address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external returns (bool);
    function transferFromAndCall(address from, address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
    function transferFromAndCall(address from, address to, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external returns (bool);
    function approveAndCall(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
    function approveAndCall(address spender, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external returns (bool);
}
```

### IERC1363Errors

[IERC1363Errors.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1363/IERC1363Errors.sol)

Interface of the ERC1363 custom errors following the [ERC-6093](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6093) rationale.

### ERC1363

[ERC1363.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1363/ERC1363.sol)

Implementation of the ERC1363 interface.

### IERC1363Receiver

[IERC1363Receiver.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1363/IERC1363Receiver.sol)

Interface for any contract that wants to support `transferAndCall` or `transferFromAndCall` from ERC1363 token contracts.

```solidity
interface IERC1363Receiver {
    function onTransferReceived(address spender, address sender, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes4);
}
```

### IERC1363Spender

[IERC1363Spender.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1363/IERC1363Spender.sol)

Interface for any contract that wants to support `approveAndCall` from ERC1363 token contracts.

```solidity
interface IERC1363Spender {
    function onApprovalReceived(address sender, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes4);
}
```

### ERC1363Holder

[ERC1363Holder.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC1363/utils/ERC1363Holder.sol)

Implementation of `IERC1363Receiver` and `IERC1363Spender` that will allow a contract to receive ERC1363 token transfers or approval.

IMPORTANT: When inheriting this contract, you must include a way to use the received tokens or spend the allowance, otherwise they will be stuck.

### ERC1363Payable

[ERC1363Payable.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/payment/ERC1363Payable.sol)

Implementation proposal of a contract that wants to accept ERC1363 payments. It intercepts what is the ERC1363 token desired for payments and throws if another is sent.

It emits a `TokensReceived` event to notify the transfer received by the contract.

It also implements a `_transferReceived` function that can be overridden to make your stuff within your contract after a `onTransferReceived`.

It emits a `TokensApproved` event to notify the approval received by the contract.

It also implements a `_approvalReceived` function that can be overridden to make your stuff within your contract after a `onApprovalReceived`.

### ERC1363PayableCrowdsale

[ERC1363PayableCrowdsale.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/examples/ERC1363PayableCrowdsale.sol)

As example: an Implementation of a classic token Crowdsale, but paid with ERC1363 tokens instead of ETH.

### ERC1363MethodCallReceiver

[ERC1363MethodCallReceiver.sol](https://github.com/vittominacori/erc1363-payable-token/blob/master/contracts/examples/ERC1363MethodCallReceiver.sol)

As example: a contract allowing to test passing methods via abi encoded function call.
