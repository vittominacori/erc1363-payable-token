/**
 * @title ERC1363PayableCrowdsale
 * @author Vittorio Minacori (https://github.com/vittominacori)
 * @dev ERC1363PayableCrowdsale is a base contract for managing a token crowdsale,
 * allowing investors to purchase tokens with ERC1363 tokens. This contract implements
 * such functionality in its most fundamental form and can be extended to provide additional
 * functionality and/or custom behavior.
 * The internal interface conforms the extensible and modifiable surface of crowdsales. Override
 * the methods to add functionality. Consider using 'super' where appropriate to concatenate
 * behavior.
